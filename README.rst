Grano User Interface
====================

``grano`` is a toolkit for building journalistic social network analysis applications on the web. This package contains an administrative user interface based on `AngularJS <http://angularjs.org/>`_. The interface is intended for managing entities 
and analysis for advanced users, not as a general-purpose interface. 

Installation
------------

``grano-ui`` requires that you have installed and configured ``grano``. Please refer to grano's documentation for further instructions. Afterwards, install the ``grano-ui`` package (from PyPI or source) into the same virtual environment. 

You'll also need to install these external (non-Python dependencies):

* Twitter's `bower <https://github.com/bower/bower>`_ for installing JS dependencies.
* `UglifyJS <https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/>`_ for JS minification.
* `Less <http://lesscss.org/>`_ for compiling the CSS resources.
